## Introduction

Logistic Regression is a widely-used algorithm for binary classification problems. It models the probability of a binary outcome using a logistic function, making it suitable for tasks like spam detection, medical diagnosis, and more. This repository provides hands-on examples and explanations of logistic regression concepts.

## Prerequisites

To work with the notebooks in this repository, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install jupyter numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
## Notebooks
This repository contains the following Jupyter Notebooks:

Notebook 1: Introduction to Logistic Regression without feature engineering 
Notebook 2: Logistic Regression Implementation with feature engineering
Each notebook provides step-by-step explanations and code examples to help you understand and implement logistic regression.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrdetective007/Introductory_Logistic_Regression.git
```
2. Navigate to the Logistic_Regression directory:
```bash
cd Introductory_Logistic_Regression/Logistic_Regression
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Explore and run the notebooks to learn about logistic regression.

## Dataset
The notebooks use a sample dataset for binary classification tasks. The dataset is loaded and preprocessed within each notebook for training and evaluation.

## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression involves modeling the probability of a binary outcome using the logistic function. It includes steps like calculating the logistic regression equation, determining the loss function, and optimizing the model parameters.

## Training
The notebooks demonstrate how to train a logistic regression model using the dataset. They explain gradient descent, cost functions, and regularization techniques.

## Evaluation
After training, the notebooks evaluate the logistic regression model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Conclusion
This repository serves as a starting point to understand and implement logistic regression. By following the notebooks, you can gain insights into binary classification and learn the foundational concepts of machine learning.
